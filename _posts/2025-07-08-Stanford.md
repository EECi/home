    This April, four PhD students from EECi — Max, Pat, Monty, and Nmeso — packed our bags and headed to sunny California for a month-long secondment at Stanford University. We went to join Ruchi, who is a Visiting Professor at Stanford while on her sabbatical, and we were lucky enough to be welcomed by the brilliant team at the <a href="https://www.uil.stanford.edu/">Urban Informatics Lab</a>, led by Professor Rishee Jain.

From day one, we were thrown into the deep end of Stanford’s buzzing research scene. Whether it was meetings, seminars, or workshops, something was always happening. Over the month, we each found our rhythm and carved out space to connect, collaborate, and reflect on our research in new ways.

The secondment was a fantastic opportunity for Max and Pat to share the findings of their research, and for Monty and Nmeso to develop collaborations and research themes to accelerate their PhD progress. We immersed ourselves in the culture of the Urban Informatics Lab and engaged with researchers across a wide range of disciplines, both on campus and beyond.

Highlights included presenting at the Stanford Sustainability Data Science Conference and visiting the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab for a roundtable discussion with some of the leading minds in the energy world — a chance to explore key issues and the future of the field.

    But it wasn’t all work! We also got a taste of the Stanford lifestyle outside of the lab — cheering on the Cardinals in softball and water polo, catching the high-energy (and high-budget) production of *Legally Blonde: The Musical*, and watching *Roman Holiday* at Palo Alto’s iconic old-school cinema. We even stumbled across a student-run festival with live music and free food! On weekends, we explored the Golden State with trips to Yosemite, Napa Valley, Redwood State Park, and of course, San Francisco.
