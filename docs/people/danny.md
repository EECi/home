## Research interests

In my research, I am exploring new approaches to enhance building efficiency, focussed on building retrofits. My primary objective is to investigate the potential of glazing as an active and integrated element within a building's connected ecosystem, with the overarching goal of facilitating the achievement of net-zero carbon emissions.

## Background

My background is in Chemical Engineering (MEng) from the University of Bath, after which I worked for three years as a Sustainability Consultant in London. I have been actively involved in a variety of projects spanning both new construction and retrofits, and I have gained experience in building modelling and whole-life carbon calculations.
