  abstract = {Abstract Amongst academics and practitioners working in the fields of urban planning and design, there has been an on-going discussion regarding the relationships between urban morphology and environmental sustainability. A main focus of analysis has been to investigate whether the form of cities and neighbourhoods can be related to their energy efficiency, especially regarding the energy intensity of buildings and transportation. However, to analyse the overall energy performance of urban systems, both the consumption and the generation of resources need to be assessed. In terms of urban environmental sustainability, the potential to generate renewable energy within the city boundaries is a research topic of growing interest, being solar energy one of the main resources available. This study uses neighbourhood-scale statistical models to explore the relationships between aggregated urban form descriptors and the potential to harvest solar energy within the city. Different possible scenarios of urban morphology in Greater London are analysed and variables of urban form are tested with the aim of increasing the solar energy potential of neighbourhoods. Results show that by optimising combinations of up to eight variables of urban form the solar irradiation of roofs could be increased by ca. 9},

The model was built by embedding a Python-based GSHP design code into ArcGIS software and was trialled on the City of Westminster, a borough in London, UK, as a case study under the two scenarios of boreholes placed under buildings and boreholes around buildings. Under both scenarios, the model produced borehole allocation maps and ratio of capacity to demand maps. The results show that a large proportion of buildings could support their own heating demands through GSHPs and, through a well-organised district heating system, GSHPs may be used efficiently to satisfy heating demands throughout an urban area.}

Household electricity consumption and \{EV\} home-charging are modeled with a Markov-chain model. \{PV\} power production is estimated from solar irradiation data from Meteonorm for the location of Westminster combined with a model for photovoltaic power production on tilted planes. The available rooftop area is estimated from the \{UK\} map geographic information database. \{EV\} home-charging increases the household electricity use mainly during evening with a maximum during winter whereas \{PV\} produces power during daytime with maximum during summer. On the household level this mismatch introduces variability in power consumption/production, which is shown to be less prominent for the large-scale scenario of the entire city of Westminster.},

Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology that transfers heat stored over long periods to/from the ground to heat/cool the buildings.

In this study, an ArcGIS-based simulation model has been developed to examine how many vertical closed loop \{GSHPs\} can be feasibly installed at city scale without overusing the geothermal energy underground. City of Westminster, in London, is used as a case study to identify and map areas where \{GSHPs\} can serve as a viable option for heating and/or cooling. A parametric study has been conducted to investigate the influence of how space heating and cooling demand is quantified on the potential utility of \{GSHP\} systems. The influence of \{COP\} variation during operation is also examined. The operational variation of \{COP\} influences the electricity consumption of the \{GSHP\} systems. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis including the capital cost, C/D ratio distribution, energy demand, and financial risk is highly recommended for district-level planning of \{GSHP\} systems.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a surge in the need for uncertainty analysis (UA) for building energy assessment. The rigorous determination of uncertainty in model parameters is a vital but often overlooked part of UA. To undertake this, one has to turn one's attention to a thriving area in engineering statistics that focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for short. This paper applies dedicated methods and theories that are emerging in this area of statistics to the field of building energy models, and specifically to the microclimate variables embedded in them. We argue that knowing the uncertainty in these variables is a vital prerequisite for ensuing UA of whole building behaviour. Indeed, significant discrepancies have been observed between the predicted and measured state variables of building microclimates. This paper uses a set of approaches from the growing UQ arsenal, mostly regression-based methods, to develop statistical models that quantify the uncertainties in the following most significant microclimate variables: local temperature, wind speed, wind pressure and solar irradiation. These are the microclimate variables used by building energy models to define boundary conditions that encapsulate the interaction of the building with the surrounding physical environment. Although our analysis is generically applicable to any of the current energy models, we will base our UQ examples on the energy model used in EnergyPlus.}

Two modelling and simulation paradigms are explored in this paper: A general greenhouse model, adapted from the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) of Pieters and Deltour, is implemented in two independent platforms, one being algorithmic MATLAB code and the other being the acausal declarative modelling language Modelica. The paper describes the key differences between the two modelling paradigms in terms of following features: (a) adequate elucidation of the physical behaviour, (b) numerical behaviour of the model in terms of stability, (c) flexibility for model improvements and extensions, (d) relevance to retrofit objectives. Results from the two models are compared to measured data from the particular greenhouse. These comparisons help understand the relative accuracy of the two models and are also indicative of areas where model resolution needs improvements.}

For thermal appliance scheduling, the thermal mass of the building, which serves as thermal storage, is integrated into the optimization problem by modeling the thermodynamics of rooms in a building as constraints. Within the comfort range modeled by the predicted mean vote (PMV) index, thermal appliances are scheduled smartly together with thermal mass storage to hedge against high prices and make use of low-price time periods. For non-thermal appliance scheduling, in which delay and/or power consumption flexibilities are available, operation dependence of inter-appliance and intra-appliance is modeled to further exploit the price variation. Simulation results show that customers have notable energy cost savings on their electricity bills with time-varying pricing.

  abstract = {Typical building energy simulation programs do not adequately describe the physical processes of heat and mass transfer which occur in a greenhouse, primarily because they do not include the interaction of the plants with their environment. This is of concern when simulation studies are required in order to assess different options for improving the greenhouse thermal performance. A previous paper (Brown et al 2012) has described the development of a model for simulation of ornamental glasshouses. Further development, in order to represent more accurately the physical processes and assess their significance, is described in this paper. The development has been undertaken in support of retrofit analysis for the glasshouses at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London, which present unique challenges in terms of their historic nature, construction details and design and have provided an opportunity to investigate the relative importance of different physical effects on the energy consumption. Within this context, the simulation has been used to explore options for improving greenhouse thermal performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract In order to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate fuel poverty, the \{UK\} Government has outlined proposals for a 'Green Deal' to help provide financing for the installation of cost-effective retrofit measures to the existing \{UK\} housing stock. However, the Green Deal proposals have the potential to generate financial risk, due to a possible overestimation of the energy savings arising from retrofit measures. This paper proposes a framework for handling the uncertainties associated with the prediction of these energy savings, as well as demonstrating how decisions can be made in the face of the uncertainties involved in the retrofit analysis of a housing stock. The proposed framework is applied to a case study set of dwellings and it is seen that a limited range of measures will be cost-effective under the Green Deal proposals for these dwellings; as a result, subsidies will be required if higher impact measures are to be considered viable. Finally, however, it is also seen that the monetary value of additional societal benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and improved thermal comfort, is likely to more than outweigh the cost of any subsidies.},

  abstract = {The spatial variability of gas consumption is investigated in non-domestic buildings across districts of Greater London, UK. It is argued that the energy consumption of a building is to some extent influenced by where the building is located in a city, due to contextual features of its own district as well as those of neighbouring districts. Using Bayesian spatial models, the analysis suggests the energy consumption due to the influence of district features can be quantified and dissociated from the energy consumption associated with the physical features and operational characteristics of the buildings. An important distinction is made between extrinsic values of energy consumption (district features) and intrinsic values (building characteristics, management and operation). The results indicate that 90\% of the mean value of extrinsic gas consumption across districts in London is between {\"i}{\textquestiondown}{$\frac{1}{2}$}??42 and 87 kWh/m2. Buildings located in districts that have positive values of extrinsic gas consumption consume more gas over and above their expected intrinsic value of gas consumption. The novel features of this study are in the quantification and propagation of district-scale features to their influence on buildings, and the reduction in uncertainties around the mean value of gas consumed by different building types.}

The internal loads are inextricably linked to occupant behaviour, both directly through the contribution of occupant heat output to thermal energy balance and indirectly via the interactions between occupants, appliances and building services. While occupancy itself is difficult to measure directly, most buildings possess a wealth of data in the form of monitored electricity consumption in varying degrees of resolution. These data, particularly plug loads, may be used to inform the model of occupant-related internal loads. Different approaches to parameterisation of plug loads have been investigated, with the purpose of exploring the conditions that might lead to preference of one approach over another. The models have been tested through a case study and simulation results have been compared against a range of response variables. Conclusions have been drawn as to the most important features of plug load parameterisation for a model to be used for forecasting future demand.},

In the building simulation environment, however, these services are commonly represented through annual transient profiles of internal heat gains, electricity loads, and set point temperatures. The intended capability of DELORES is to stochastically generate such profiles for use in common building energy models, such as TRNSYS and EnergyPlus, and do so whilst presenting users with a straight-forward, easy-to-use interface. By furthering the dissemination of this tool in the public domain, and encouraging it is future development, it is hoped that multidisciplinary research related to stochastic occupant behaviour and energy demand will become an easier task.},

We demonstrate that the GP-MCEM framework yields more robust predictions and confidence levels compared with standard GP training approaches that neglect uncertainty. We argue that the approach can also reduce data needs because it implicitly expands the data range used for training and can thus be used as a mechanism to reduce data collection and sensor installation costs in M\&amp;V processes. We analyze the numerical behavior of the framework and conclude that robust predictions can be obtained with relatively few samples.}

For an existing building, while a detailed energy audit may be undertaken, attaining accurate internal load profiles for every space of the building can be prohibitive. In reality, the variation of internal loads over time is inherently stochastic. In order to develop a stochastic model of building operations, a number of studies have proposed parameterisations that incorporate some estimation of variability, with different assumptions and levels of complexity.

A common aspect in such analyses is that there is generally a set of key explanatory variables {\"i}{\textquestiondown}{$\frac{1}{2}$} or the main inputs {\"i}{\textquestiondown}{$\frac{1}{2}$} that are statistically related to a quantity of interest (end-use energy or CO2). In the context of energy use in buildings, it is not uncommon that the explanatory variables may be correlated. However, there has been little discussion about the correlated variables in building stock research. This paper uses a set of campus buildings as a demonstrative case study to investigate the application of variable importance and meta-model construction in the case of correlated inputs when quantifying energy demand of a building stock. The variable importance analysis can identify key factors that explain energy consumption of a building stock. To this end, it is necessary to apply methods suitable for correlated inputs because the observational data (inputs) of buildings are usually correlated. For constructing statistical energy meta-models, two types of regression models are used: linear and non-parametric models. The results indicate that the linear models perform well compared to the complicated non-parametric models in this case. In addition, a simple transformation of the response, commonly used in linear regression, can improve predictive performance of both the linear and non-parametric models.}

  abstract = {Rapid growth in the global population requires expansion of building stock, which in turn calls for increased energy demand. This demand varies in time and also between different buildings, yet, conventional methods are only able to provide mean energy levels per zone and are unable to capture this inhomogeneity, which is important to conserve energy. An additional challenge is that some of the attempts to conserve energy, through for example lowering of ventilation rates, have been shown to exacerbate another problem, which is unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ). The rise of sensing technology over the past decade has shown potential to address both these issues simultaneously by providing high-resolution tempo-spatial data to systematically analyse the energy demand and its consumption as well as the impacts of measures taken to control energy consumption on IAQ. However, challenges remain in the development of affordable services for data analysis, deployment of large-scale real-time Urban environment sensing network and responding through Building Energy Management Systems. This article presents the fundamental drivers behind the rise of sensing technology for the management of energy and IAQ in urban built environments, highlights major challenges for their large-scale deployment and identifies the research gaps that should be closed by future investigations.}

Calibration results can then be assessed by comparing two datasets: the simulated land-use map and the actual land-use map at the same time. A common method for this is the Kappa statistic, which expresses the agreement between two categorical datasets corrected for the expected agreement. This expected agreement is based on a stochastic model of random allocation given the distribution of class sizes. However, when a model starts from an initial land-use map and makes changes to it, that stochastic model does not pose a meaningful reference level. This paper introduces KSimulation, a statistic that is identical in form to the Kappa statistic but instead applies a more appropriate stochastic model of random allocation of class transitions relative to the initial map. The new method is illustrated on a simple example and then the results of the Kappa statistic and KSimulation are compared using the results of a land-use model. It is found that only KSimulation truly tests models in their capacity to explain land-use changes over time, and unlike Kappa it does not inflate results for simulations where little change takes place over time.},

  abstract = {The diversity of non-domestic buildings at urban scale poses a number of difficulties to develop models for large scale analysis of the stock. This research proposes a probabilistic, engineering-based, bottom-up model to address these issues. In a recent study we classified London's non-domestic buildings based on the service they provide, such as offices, retail premise, and schools, and proposed the creation of one probabilistic representational model per building type. This paper investigates techniques for the development of such models. The representational model is a statistical surrogate of a dynamic energy simulation (ES) model. We first identify the main parameters affecting energy consumption in a particular building sector/type by using sampling-based global sensitivity analysis methods, and then generate statistical surrogate models of the dynamic ES model within the dominant model parameters. Given a sample of actual energy consumption for that sector, we use the surrogate model to infer the distribution of model parameters by inverse analysis. The inferred distributions of input parameters are able to quantify the relative benefits of alternative energy saving measures on an entire building sector with requisite quantification of uncertainties. Secondary school buildings are used for illustrating the application of this probabilistic method.},

This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

  abstract = {Geosimulation is a form of microsimulation that seeks to understand geographical patterns and dynamics as the outcome of micro-level geographical processes. Geosimulation has been applied to understand such diverse systems as lake ecology, traffic congestion and urban growth. A crucial task common to these applications is to express the agreement between model and reality and hence the confidence one can have in model results. Such evaluation requires a geospatial perspective; it is not sufficient if micro-level interactions are realistic. Importantly, interactions should be such that meso- and macro- level patterns emerging from the model are realistic. In recent years, a host of map comparison methods have been developed, which address different aspects of the agreement between model and reality. This paper places such methods in a framework to systematically assess breadth and width of model performance. The framework expresses agreement at the continuum of spatial scales ranging from local to whole landscape and separately addresses agreement in structure and presence. A common reference level makes different performance metrics mutually comparable and guides the interpretation of results. The framework is applied for the evaluation of a constrained cellular automata model of the Netherlands. The case demonstrates that a performance assessment lacking either a multi-criteria and multi-scale perspective or a reference level would result in an unbalanced account and ultimately false conclusions.},

  abstract = {Spatial interaction models commonly use discrete zones to represent locations. The computational requirements of the models normally arise with the square of the number of zones or worse. For computationally intensive models, such as land use{\"i}{\textquestiondown}{$\frac{1}{2}$}transport interaction models and activity-based models for city regions, this dependency of zone size is a long-standing problem that has not disappeared even with increasing computation speed in PCs{\"i}{\textquestiondown}{$\frac{1}{2}$}it still forces modelers to compromise on the spatial resolution and extent of model coverage as well as on the rigor and depth of model-based analysis. This article introduces a new type of discrete zone system, with the objective of reducing the time for estimating and applying spatial interaction models while maintaining their accuracy. The premise of the new system is that the appropriate size of destination zones depends on the distance to their origin zone: at short distances, spatial accuracy is important and destination zones must be small; at longer distances, knowing the precise location becomes less important and zones can be larger. The new method defines a specific zone map for every origin zone; each origin zone becomes the focus of its own map, surrounded by small zones nearby and large zones farther away. We present the theoretical formulation of the new method and test it with a model of commuting in England. The results of the new method are equivalent to those of the conventional model, despite reducing the number of zone pairs by 96\% and the computation time by 70\%.},

Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) are a technology which can reduce carbon emissions from heating and cooling. GSHP system performance is however highly sensitive to deviation from design values of the actual annual energy extraction/rejection rates from/to the ground. In order to prevent failure and/or performance deterioration of GSHP systems it is possible to incorporate a safety factor in the design of the GSHP by over-sizing the ground heat exchanger (GHE). A methodology to evaluate the financial risk involved in over-sizing the GHE is proposed is this paper. A probability based approach is used to evaluate the economic feasibility of a hypothetical full-size GSHP system as compared to four alternative Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system configurations. The model of the GSHP system is developed in the TRNSYS energy simulation platform and calibrated with data from an actual hybrid GSHP system installed in the Department of Earth Science, University of Oxford, UK. Results of the analysis show that potential savings from a full-size GSHP system largely depend on projected HVAC system efficiencies and gas and electricity prices. Results of the risk analysis also suggest that a full-size GSHP with auxiliary back up is potentially the most economical system configuration.},

The resulting model is able to describe the spread due to variation of energy consumption across buildings within a similar category. These spreads (or distributions) can be used for estimating the probability distribution of the gross energy consumption per local authority in Greater London. The work is driven by the need to quantify future energy demand of buildings in their urban context as a function of projected growth of buildings and populations, refurbishments, policies incentivizing energy efficiency measures, and changes in building operation. The focus on the non-domestic sector enables a framework that accommodates diverse set of activities and uses of buildings within an urban region.},

  abstract = {Representing nonlinear curves as piecewise elements allows complex systems to be optimised by linear programs. Piecewise linearisation has been recently introduced in the context of distributed energy system optimisation. It is an efficient technique for representing non-linear technology behaviours in linear optimisation models, which are favourable in district energy optimisation models, owing to their speed and ability to handle large numbers of design variables. This paper describes a method of automating the creation of piecewise elements of technology performance curves for minimum fit error. The results show an objective function value improvement at a relatively large penalty in solution time: from 1.6 times to 58 times longer than describing technologies as having a single value for efficiency (SVE). We show that within the context of common technology performance curves, three breakpoints yield sufficiently accurate results and any returns are diminishing beyond that. Even at three breakpoints, it is evident that the placement of breakpoints along a curve significantly influences solution time, in a way for which it is not possible to account in automation. But, large savings can be made by automation by including a constraint to ensure piecewise curves have a strictly increasing/decreasing gradient. This avoids the use of special ordered sets, simplifying model generation and the number of non-continuous variables. SVE models provide a less realistic solution and application of nonlinear consumption curves ex-post shows them to be ultimately more expensive systems than their piecewise counterparts. However, this ex-post analysis applied to SVE models is a good compromise for feasibility level analyses, where whole system cost is key. However, investment decisions and operation schedules are markedly affected by consumption curve representation. Thus, the use of piecewise linearisation is beneficial for detailed design, particularly if automation of breakpoint allocation can help solve the issue of model convergence.},

This variability is rarely captured in district energy modelling and optimisation. In this paper, we demonstrate a modelling approach that integrates the stochastic variability of energy demand in energy system optimisation. In our set-up, energy demand is a stochastic function over time, separated into weekdays and weekends in a year. We consider cooling and electricity as end-uses. We implement the district energy optimisation using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) Scenario optimisation (SO) framework. The stochastic variability of hourly demand is represented by 500 scenarios for 24 typical days in the year. For computational efficiency, we implement a scenario reduction step, resulting in 16 reduced scenarios as representative of the full scenario set. These 16 scenarios are used to formulate an SO model for a group of office buildings in Bangalore, India. The objective in this model is to minimise the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) associated with each scenario, weighted by the probability of that scenario being realised. A scenario can have some demand unmet, but this will incur a financial penalty. To better understand the necessary parametrisation of the model, the penalty for unmet demand is tested by sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {Current district energy optimisation depends on perfect foresight. However, we rarely know how the future will transpire when undertaking infrastructure planning. A key uncertainty that has yet to be studied in this context is building-level energy demand. Energy demand varies stochastically on a daily basis, owing to activities and weather. Yet, most current district optimisation models consider only the average demand. Studies that incorporate demand uncertainty ignore the temporal autocorrelation of energy demand, or require a detailed engineering model for which there is no validation against real consumption data. In this paper, we propose a new 3-step methodology for handling demand uncertainty in mixed integer linear programming models of district energy systems. The three steps are: scenario generation, scenario reduction, and scenario optimisation. Our proposed framework is data-centric, based on sampling of historic demand data using multidimensional search spaces. 500 scenarios are generated from the historical demand of multiple buildings, requiring historical data to be nonparametrically sampled whilst maintaining interdependence of hourly demand in a day. Using scenario reduction, we are able to select a subset of scenarios that best represent the probability distribution of our large number of initial scenarios. The scenario optimisation step constitutes minimising the cost of technology investment and operation, where all realisations of demand from the reduced scenarios are probabilistically weighted in the objective function. We applied these three steps to a real district development in Cambridge, UK, and an illustrative district in Bangalore, India. Our results show that the technology investment portfolios derived from our 3-step methodology are more robust in meeting large possible variations in demand than any model optimised independently with a single demand scenario. This increased robustness comes at a higher monetary cost of investment. However, the high investment cost is lower than the highest possible cost when each of the initial 500 scenarios is optimised independently. In both our case studies, building level energy systems are always more robust than district level ones, a result which disagrees with many existing studies. The outcomes enable better examination of district energy systems. In addition, our methodology is compiled as an open-source code that can be applied to optimise existing and future energy masterplans of districts.},

  abstract = {There is currently no established methodology for quantifying uncertainty in occupant-related building internal loads. In this paper, we propose that distinct spaces within a building may be assigned an opera- tional signature comprising the daily base load, load range and diversity profile. A Functional Data Anal- ysis (FDA) approach has been used to analyse moni- tored electricity consumption data for the derivation of such signatures. This approach enables simula- tion of the inherent stochasticity. It represents a step forward towards an ability to propagate uncertainty through a building energy simulation and to quantify the change in electricity consumption associated with a change in building operation.}

  abstract = {Significant reduction in energy demand from non-domestic buildings is required if greenhouse emission reduction targets are to be met worldwide. Increasing monitoring of electricity consumption generates a real opportunity for gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature of occupant-related internal loads and the connection between activity and demand. The stochastic nature of the demand is well-known but as yet there is no accepted methodology for generating stochastic loads for building energy simulation. This paper presents evidence that it is feasible to generate stochastic models of activity-related electricity demand based on monitored data. Two machine learning approaches are used to develop stochastic models of plug loads; an autoencoder (AE) and a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) model. Using data from two office buildings located in different countries, the transferability of models is explored by training the models on data from one building and using the trained models to predict demand for the other building. The results show that both models predict plug loads satisfactorily, with a good agreement with the mean demand and quantification of the uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Data scarcity and high development costs pose significant challenges to building-specific energy demand forecasting models. To address these issues, this study introduces a time series similarity assessment method that utilizes TS2Vec, an unsupervised learning-based encoder for extracting time series representation vectors. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using anonymized datasets of building electricity usage from Cambridge, UK. The proposed methodology stands out for its ability to identify high-similarity data segments by flexibly adjusting the evaluation time window used for extracting representation vectors, outperforming traditional average similarity assessments. Principal component analysis was employed for dimensionality reduction and visualization, alongside a moving window cosine similarity approach to enhance the interpretability of complex multivariate time series data similarities. The study's key findings are as follows. First, dynamic similarity analysis effectively captured the complexity of building energy use patterns. Second, the approach demonstrated the potential to optimize transfer learning by automatically identifying the most suitable source data. Third, the study explored the feasibility of employing dynamic model selection and ensemble techniques based on temporal similarity changes. This study proposes a practical and scalable methodology to mitigate data scarcity and reduce model development costs, thereby facilitating more efficient, adaptive, and accurate energy demand forecasting.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technologies offer much promise to the risk management of the built environment, and they are therefore an active area of research. However, information regarding material properties, such as toughness and strength is instead measured in destructive lab tests. Similarly, the presence of geometrical anomalies is more commonly detected and sized by inspection. Therefore, a risk-optimal combination should be sought, acknowledging that different scenarios will be associated with different data requirements. Value of Information (VoI) analysis is an established statistical framework for quantifying the expected benefit of a prospective data collection activity. In this paper the expected value of various combinations of inspection, SHM and testing are quantified, in the context of supporting risk management of a location of stress concentration in a railway bridge. The Julia code for this analysis (probabilistic models and influence diagrams) is made available. The system-level results differ from a simple linear sum of marginal VoI estimates, i.e. the expected value of collecting data from SHM and inspection together is not equal to the expected value of SHM data plus the expected value of inspection data. In summary, system-level decision making, requires system-level models.},

Three energy decision-making examples are presented: ventilation scheduling, heat pump maintenance scheduling, and ground source heat pump design.

  abstract = {Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building energy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly. This study quantifies the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, to determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. Value of Information analysis (VoI) is a numerical framework for quantifying the benefit of uncertainty reduction to support decision making. An extension of the framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data. Load uncertainty is found to have a significant impact on both system operating costs ({\textbackslash}pm30\%) and the optimal system design ({\textbackslash}pm20\%). However, using building monitoring is found to reduce overall costs by less than 2\% on average, less than the cost of measurement, and is therefore not economically worthwhile. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide all available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides no benefit for energy retrofit design.},

However, no existing studies in the building energy systems literature have quantified the economic benefits of data collection strategies to determine whether they are worth their cost. This work demonstrates that Value of Information analysis (VoI), a Bayesian Decision Analysis framework, provides a suitable methodology for quantifying the benefits of data collection. Three example decision problems in building energy systems are studied: air-source heat pump maintenance scheduling, ventilation scheduling for indoor air quality, and ground-source heat pump system design. Smart meters, occupancy monitoring systems, and ground thermal tests are shown to be economically beneficial for supporting these decisions respectively. It is proposed that further study of VoI in building energy systems would allow expenditure on data collection to be economized and prioritised, avoiding wastage.},

  abstract = {Digital twin models serve as the most crucial foundation for estimating the expected conservation effects of building energy systems. The establishment of digital twin models relies heavily on the detailed design parameters of building energy systems, including component topology, power, and efficiency. However, a considerable number of existing buildings lack complete modeling parameters. It is challenging to impute the incomplete parameters for building energy systems, since the different building energy systems have different modeling parameters and different amounts of incomplete parameters. To address this challenge, a self-attention variational autoencoder-based method is proposed. Its basic idea is to employ the self-attention mechanism to identify the key parameters within the entire parameters, and to learn the relationships between the incomplete parameters and the key parameters. The method comprises three steps: feature embedding, model building, and supervised learning. The feature embedding is employed to represent the features of building energy systems, with each feature carrying a physical meaning. A self-attention variational autoencoder model is then applied to impute the incomplete parameters based on the available parameters and the relationship between the incomplete parameters and the key parameters. Supervised learning is adopted to train the model based on the principles of the evidence lower bound. The evaluations are conducted using 350 various practical building energy systems sourced from the excellent design atlas in China. Three representative incomplete parameter imputation methods are selected as baseline models for performance comparison. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits high imputation accuracy, good flexibility, and good interpretability.},
